# 🎬 Movie Data Science Portfolio Project

**Author:** Arunkumar  
**Date:** June 2025

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores a real-world movie dataset (from Letterboxd) to showcase data science and machine learning techniques.  
It demonstrates the full workflow from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to building recommendation systems and predictive models for genre classification.

---

## 📂 Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualize and summarize patterns in movie popularity, genres, ratings, and trends.

- **Content-Based Recommendation System:**
  - Recommend similar movies using feature-based similarity with TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
  - Classic approach for situations where user preference data is limited.

- **Genre Prediction with Machine Learning:**
  - Predict a movie's main genre based on its plot description using a Random Forest classifier.
  - Example of practical NLP (text vectorization) and supervised classification.
